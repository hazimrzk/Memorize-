# Memorize!

Memorize! is a card game developed natively for iOS devices via SwiftUI framework. It is done as one of the completion requirements for CS193p - Developing Apps for iOS by Stanford University. This project and the online course were finished as one of my self-learning initiatives to learn programming independently.

Memorize is the software rendition of the classic memory game in which a deck of card is laid out, and 2 cards are flipped face up per turn. The player gains a score for every matching pair and loses points for each incorrect attempt. The goal of this game is to finish the deck by matching every card with its identical pairs.
